ANALYSIS:
	TYPE = COMPLEX MIXTURE ; ! growth mixture model with complex structure
      	OPTSEED = 481835 ;


MODEL:
! This model includes an intercept (i) and linear slope (s)

    %OVERALL%
     i s | sisoe5@0 sisoe7@2 sisoe10@5 sisoe12@7 ; ! need to check time points here 
     
     i-s ; ! Allows class-specific random effects (for intercept and linear slope)
