TITLE: Single-class linear growth curve model in full sample with clustering


DATA:

   ! using file saved on desktop as doesn't like long paths

VARIABLE: 
	NAMES =

	risks cohort sampsex zygosity seswq35 
	sisoe5 sisoe7 sisoe10 sisoe12 
	log_5 log_7 log_10 log_12 ;

	USEVARIABLES = sisoe5 sisoe7 sisoe10 sisoe12;

	MISSING = .; ! . are missing values

! To restrict to specific variable only, eg for girls only USEOBSERVATIONS sampsex EQ 2;  

	IDVARIABLE = id ;
	
	CLUSTER = familyid ; !control for twins in sample
	
ANALYSIS:
	TYPE = COMPLEX ; ! to account for complex twin structure

MODEL:
! This model includes an intercept (i) and linear slope (s). Add (q) for quadratic

PLOT:

OUTPUT:	
	sampstat standardized
