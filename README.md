# Childhood_social_isolation_trajectories-GMM
This repository holds code for GMM and LCGA using social isolation variables at ages 5, 7, 10 and 12 in the E-Risk study. 
Associated with manuscript titled: "Early life factors associated with trajectories of childhood social isolation"

All code written by Katherine N Thompson.
Analyses for this project were conducted in MPlus (Version 8.4). 

This repository includes the following Mplus and R scripts to estimate: 

Three types of latent trajectory models:

1. GROWTH MIXTURE MODEL: 
 - Mplus code for linear and quadratic models (will be uploaded in a txt file once complete)

2. LATENT CLASS GROWTH ANALYSIS: 
 - Mplus code for linear and quadratic models (will be uploaded in a txt file once complete)
     
3. LATENT GROWTH MODEL:
 - Mplus code for linear and quadratic models (will be uploaded in a txt file once complete)
