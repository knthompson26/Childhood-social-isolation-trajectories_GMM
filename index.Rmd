This websites holds analysis code and results for the manuscript titled: **Trajectories of childhood social isolation in a nationally representative cohort: Associations with antecedents and early adulthood outcomes.** 


Authors: Katherine N. Thompson, Candice L. Odgers, Bridget T. Bryan, Andrea Danese, Lily Strange, Timothy Matthews, and Louise Arseneault

All code written by Katherine N Thompson and reviewed by Jessica Agnew-Blais. Analyses for this project were conducted in MPlus version 8.4, STATA version 16, and R version 4.0.3 (All R code written in Rmd format). 

All data provided by the **Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin (E-Risk) Study**.


All following links are displayed in the order that the code was run for these analyses. For all Mplus, STATA and R raw code files, please see the github repository by clicking the Github icon in the top right corner.
